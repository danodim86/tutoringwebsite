          <p class="about-text">As an 18-year old math tutor, I have a unique perspective on tutoring that sets me apart from many others in the field. Having just recently graduated from the educational system, I know firsthand what it's like to struggle with math and the difficulties that come with it.

           <br><br> I understand that students often need more than just academic knowledge in order to improve their math skills. That's why I take a personalized approach to tutoring that focuses not only on the subject matter but also on building the student's confidence and helping them develop effective study habits.
            
           <br><br> My passion for math and teaching has led me to pursue this career, and I am committed to helping students reach their full potential. With my knowledge, experience, and dedication, I am confident that I can make a difference in the lives of my students and help them succeed in math and beyond.

          <p class="problem-solving-text">Problem Solving</p>       
          <p class="problem-solving-explanation">Problem-solving is one of my core strengths. I am able to break down complex 
            problems into simpler steps and guide my students through the problem-solving process. I encourage my students to 
            think outside the box and explore different approaches to solving a problem. By doing so, I am able to foster creativity 
            and critical thinking in my students, which helps them develop problem-solving skills that they can apply in their academic 
            and personal lives. I believe that problem-solving is a crucial skill that everyone should possess, and I strive to help my 
            students develop this skill to its fullest potential.

          <p class="analytical-thinking-explanation">I consider analytical thinking to be an essential quality for helping my 
            students achieve success. With my strong analytical thinking skills, I am able to help students deconstruct complex 
            problems and approach them from different angles, leading to a better understanding of the underlying principles of mathematics. 
            This requires a great deal of analytical thinking, as
            well as the ability to identify patterns and relationships between different mathematical concepts.
            I believe that by encouraging my students to think analytically, I can help them develop a deeper understanding of 
            the fundamental concepts of mathematics.

          <p class="passion-explanation">
            Another key quality that I bring to my math tutoring is my passion for the subject. Math is a fascinating and challenging subject 
            that requires patience and dedication to master. By sharing my love for math with my students, I hope to inspire them to develop 
            their own appreciation for the subject. Whether it's teaching a new concept, guiding a student through a difficult problem, or simply
            sharing interesting facts about math, I am always eager to share my passion for the subject with my students.

            I understand the importance of effective communication. Being able to explain complex mathematical concepts in a way that is easy 
            to understand is essential for helping my students succeed. I strive to communicate clearly and effectively with my students, using 
            language and examples that are tailored to their individual needs and learning styles. By fostering a positive and open environment 
            for communication, I can help my students feel more comfortable asking questions and seeking help when they need it.

              I worked as a tutor at a tutoring company for several months and during this time I gained valuable experience working with students of all ages and levels. 
              It was incredibly rewarding to see students improve their skills and gain confidence in their abilities over time. As I continued to tutor,
              I discovered that I had a passion for teaching math and helping students achieve their full potential in the subject.
              <br><br>This experience inspired me to start my own tutoring business, where I could focus on creating a teaching routine that is tailored to each 
              student's needs and learning style. I realized that with the right approach, every student can excel in math and achieve their goals. I am committed
              to providing my students with the support and guidance they need to succeed and reach their full potential.
              <br><br>Working as a tutor opened my eyes to the power of individualized teaching and inspired me to pursue my passion for math education. 
              I am excited to continue on this journey, helping students develop a love for math and the confidence to tackle any challenge that comes their way.

              Throughout my years of studying mathematics, I have had the opportunity to work with many different fields of mathematics such as number theory, 
              combinatorics, geometry, algebra manipulation, functional equations, and more. My experience in participating in numerous competitions, both at 
              the state and olympiad level, both in Britain and my native country, has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of these out-of-syllabus math topics.
             <br><br> This exposure to complex mathematical topics has also helped me develop a solid understanding of many other less complicated topics, such as those 
             in the maths syllabus in the UK educational system. However, what has truly helped me excel in mathematics is my understanding of the importance of 
             problem-solving skills. While school teaches the steps to solve math problems, they do not emphasize the importance of problem-solving skills.

              Unfortunately, this is an area that schools often neglect, focusing instead on memorizing formulas and procedures. However, through my extensive experience 
              in maths competitions and out of syllabus topics, I have developed strong problem-solving skills, which I believe are essential to truly excel in mathematics. As a 
              private maths tutor, I emphasize the importance of problem-solving with my students, teaching them how to analyze and break down complex problems, identify relevant 
              information, and apply appropriate mathematical techniques to find solutions. By doing so, my students are able to develop their own problem-solving strategies, which 
              not only helps them excel in maths but also gives them valuable skills that they can use in other areas of their lives. This approach has proven to be highly effective, 
              as many of my students have gone on to achieve great success in their maths exams and competitions.
